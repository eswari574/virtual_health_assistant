what is the project does?
A Virtual Health Assistant is an AI-powered tool designed to assist users with basic health-related queries and medical appointments. It provides instant responses to common health concerns, offering general advice based on symptoms. The assistant does not replace doctors but helps users understand their conditions better. It can suggest possible causes for symptoms and recommend whether medical attention is needed. Additionally, it helps users find and book doctor appointments based on availability and specialization. The system ensures convenience by reducing wait times and providing accessible healthcare support. With natural language processing, it engages in user-friendly conversations. The assistant is available 24/7, making healthcare assistance more accessible. It enhances the patient experience by bridging the gap between self-care and professional consultation.
